## ðŸ’¬ About the Project
Our project involves the development of a shared workspace application tailored for both students and businesses. Our primary objective is to combine distinct features found in various web applications onto an unified platform.

We plan to incorporate two key features. The first feature entails a streamlined file transfer system, while the second will be a gantt chart where users can visually keep track of their assignments along with its due date and time. Additionally, as an enhancement, we intend to include a daily motivational quote, specifically curated for students who may experience heightened stress levels. This quote will be updated daily to provide a fresh and uplifting message.
